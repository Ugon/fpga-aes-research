\subsection{AES encryption round}

AES Encryption rounds consist of four transformations explained in previous sections. A circuit that can be used to implement a round is presented in figure \ref{fig:aes-round}.

256-bit version of AES encryption algorithm, which is analysed here, has 15 rounds. Rounds 2 to 14 are the same and use all four transformations (fig. \ref{fig:aes-round}). First round only applies AddRoundKey transformation to the state. Last round is similar to rounds 2 to 14, but it does not apply MixColumns transformation.
